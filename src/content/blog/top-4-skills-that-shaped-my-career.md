Hello! In this video, Iâ€™ll talk about the top 4 skills that have significantly shaped and supported my career. Today, Iâ€™m at NaplÃ¡s Lake in beautiful Budapest. As I take a peaceful walk around this stunning lake, where I can see cows and horses grazing nearby, Iâ€™ll share my journey and experiences with these important skills.

## Communication

We all know that communication is key. Itâ€™s not necessarily about having perfect grammar or advanced linguistic skills in English or any other language. Whatâ€™s important is understanding the context, knowing how to respond appropriately, and sharing information in a timely and clear manner across teams. This also involves respecting the diversity of experiences and personal levels within the team. 

Effective communication becomes second nature when you know how to connect with and engage team members. Once you've mastered this, youâ€™re well-equipped to lead and collaborate with those you are responsible for.

## Emotional Intelligence

Within us, the heart and mind must work together harmoniously. Emotional intelligence plays a crucial role in handling challenges and interactions at work. Events or misunderstandings may impact us emotionally â€” people may complain, disagree, or express frustrations. This is where conflict resolution comes in.

To maintain professionalism, we need to manage our emotions, exchange mutual respect, and listen actively. When disagreements arise, itâ€™s important to have productive discussions and work toward practical solutions. As leaders, itâ€™s also critical to assess situations calmly, adapt our leadership style, and embrace challenges as opportunities for growth. 

In my experience, even negative encounters contribute to personal and professional development. They strengthen us and teach us how to improve for the future.

## Work and Life

The phrase "work-life balance" may not always reflect reality. Personally, I prefer the term **"work-life harmony."** What does that mean? Itâ€™s not about rigidly sticking to a 9-to-5 schedule and then stopping everything afterward. Instead, itâ€™s about aligning your energy and motivation to create a fulfilling and sustainable rhythm between work and personal life.

Work and free time can coexist harmoniously. For instance, finding joy and purpose at work while also setting aside time to relax, spend with your family, or engage in hobbies can contribute to this harmony. Scheduling moments for both your productivity and leisure ensures better mental health and long-term career success.

## Vulnerability

As human beings, we all make mistakes. We have the right to show our weaknesses and embrace our vulnerable moments. By being real and transparent about your experiences, you pave the way for stronger connections with your team. Vulnerability bridges gaps and inspires collaboration.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve been involved in different organizations, including small companies where I learned a lot from setbacks and failures. All these that taught me lessons that shaped me as a leader. For that, Iâ€™m deeply grateful. 

Iâ€™ve had the chance to organize events, host tech talks, and lead diverse projects, which involved supporting and communicating with different teams. 

At my current company, Iâ€™ve faced challenges, but Iâ€™m fortunate to have a supportive environment. 

One key takeaway is that no matter how much experience or knowledge we have, itâ€™s never perfect or complete. Outdated knowledge must be updated and refined over time to stay relevant and continually improve.

## Final Thoughts

While these are my top 4 skills, there are many others that come into play in my daily work and leadership journey. It's not just about mastering skills â€” itâ€™s also about self-reflection, growth, and sharing experiences to foster collaboration.
