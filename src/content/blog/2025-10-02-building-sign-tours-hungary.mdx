## Achievements

On Sept 28, we hit "deploy" on a project that is incredibly close to our hearts. We are proud to announce that [www.SignToursHungary.com](http://www.signtourshungary.com), a platform we developed for our partners at the JOF Foundation, is now live. This website is a milestone for our company and for digital accessibility in Hungary. It offers deaf and hard-of-hearing travelers a chance to explore 30 of the country's most beautiful landmarks through over 257 minutes of rich, engaging content in Hungarian and International Sign Language.

## Accessibility

Our guiding principle for this project was to create a "visual-first" experience. In a world dominated by text, we wanted to build a space where visual language is primary. This philosophy influenced every technical and design decision our team made.

The user journey begins with an interactive map, designed with clean, large, touch-friendly icons that are easy to use on any device. The sign language videos are presented in a high-quality, lightweight player, ensuring they are the focus of the page. We didn't stop there. Under the hood, our team implemented a strict Content Security Policy to protect user data, optimized every page for search engines (SEO) so deaf travelers can easily find this resource, and built a robust internationalization (i18n) framework to support multiple languages seamlessly. This is accessibility that is more than skin deep.

## Deaf Seamless Collaboration

The most powerful stories are told by those who have lived them. That's why the story behind this platform is just as important as the product itself.

[www.SignToursHungary.com](http://www.signtourshungary.com) was built by two of our deaf software engineers, who volunteered over 100 hours of their expertise. This project was more than a client-developer relationship; it was a partnership built on a shared language and identity. All project meetings, technical deep-dives, code reviews, and feedback sessions with the JOF Foundation were conducted entirely in sign language.

This created an environment of unparalleled transparency, trust, and efficiency. There were no "lost in translation" moments. The feedback was direct, the understanding was instant, and the collaboration was genuinely enjoyable. This process allowed us to build not just what the client *asked for*, but what the community truly *needed*. It is a testament to our belief that the most authentic products are built by the people they are meant to serve.

## Call to Action

We strongly encourage you to visit [www.SignToursHungary.com](http://www.signtourshungary.com) to see this work in action. Share it with friends, family, and anyone interested in travel and accessibility.

The principles of seamless, native-language collaboration and deep user understanding that made this project a success are at the core of what we do at Sign Language Tech. If you are looking to build truly authentic and impactful digital experiences for the deaf community, your search ends here.
