You are working in an Astro (v5) + TypeScript website repo using pnpm.

General
- Prefer small, surgical changes; keep diffs minimal and readable.
- Follow existing code style and patterns in nearby files.
- Use clear naming; keep components and helpers focused.

Project conventions
- Always use pnpm for any command you run in this repo. Do NOT use `npm`, `npx`, or `yarn`.
  - Use `pnpm add` / `pnpm remove` instead of `npm install` / `npm uninstall`
  - Use `pnpm run <script>` (or `pnpm <script>`) instead of `npm run <script>`
  - Use `pnpm dlx <pkg>` instead of `npx <pkg>`
  - Use `pnpm exec <bin>` instead of `npx <bin>` when the binary is already installed
- Astro components live in `src/components/*.astro`; pages in `src/pages`; layouts in `src/layouts`.
- Prefer TypeScript for new logic in `src/helpers` or other TS modules.

Do not touch generated/vendor content
- Do NOT edit `dist/` or `node_modules/`.
- Prefer editing source files under `src/` and assets under `public/`.

Quality bar
- After substantive changes, ensure `pnpm build` (runs `astro check`) passes.
- If you introduce new types/interfaces, keep them simple and colocated unless reused broadly.
- Avoid breaking links, routes, or content collections; update references when moving/renaming files.

Docs & content
- When editing `src/content`, preserve frontmatter/metadata and existing formatting.
- Keep copy changes intentional; avoid rewriting unrelated prose.
